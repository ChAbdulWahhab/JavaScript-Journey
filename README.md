# JavaScript Journey

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll explore the core concepts of **JavaScript** and how it can be used to build dynamic web pages. Imagine a company that wants to allow users to shop online via their website, handle payment details, and dynamically display products. JavaScript can be used to make these tasks smooth and efficient by interacting with the user in real-time, validating input, and dynamically updating the content of web pages.

## 1. Scripting

Scripting is a sequence of commands executed sequentially when an event occurs on a webpage. These events can be user actions like clicking a button, selecting a product, or filling out a form. Scripting languages are often embedded in HTML to make web pages interactive.

### Types of Scripting Languages:

1. **Client-side Scripting**: Runs on the user's browser (e.g., JavaScript).
2. **Server-side Scripting**: Runs on the web server to generate dynamic content for the user.

## 2. JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a powerful scripting language that enables interactivity on web pages. It is an **object-based** language, where objects represent entities with characteristics (state) and behaviors (actions).

### Example of Objects in JavaScript

| **Car**                           | **Table**              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Identity**: BMW F90 M5          | **Identity**: T002     |
| **State**: Color-Red, Wheels-Four | **State**: Color-Brown |
| **Behavior**: Running             | **Behavior**: Stable   |

## 3. Versions of JavaScript (ECMAScript)

JavaScript has evolved over the years through different versions, each adding new features and improving functionality. Below are the major versions:

| **Edition** | **Name**            | **Description**                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | ECMAScript 1 (1997) | First edition                                                                      |
| 2           | ECMAScript 2 (1998) | Supported by Internet Explorer 4.0                                                 |
| 3           | ECMAScript 3 (1999) | Added regular expressions, try/catch; supported by IE 5.0, Netscape 1.0, Opera 5.0 |
| 5           | ECMAScript 5 (2009) | Introduced 'strict mode', JSON support, and new Array methods                      |
| 6           | ECMAScript 2015     | Added `let`, `const`, and Array methods like `find()`                              |
| 7           | ECMAScript 2016     | Added exponential operator, Array.prototype.includes                               |
| 8           | ECMAScript 2017     | Added string padding, async functions, and shared memory                           |
| 9           | ECMAScript 2018     | Added async iteration, rest/spread properties, Promise.finally()                   |
| 10          | ECMAScript 2019     | Introduced `Array.prototype.flat`, `Object.fromEntries`                            |
| 11          | ECMAScript 2020     | Introduced BigInt, nullish coalescing, and `globalThis`                            |
| 12          | ECMAScript 2021     | Added `replaceAll` method, `Promise.any`, and `WeakRef`                            |

## 4. Client-side JavaScript

Client-side JavaScript is executed in the browser on the user's machine. It's responsible for making webpages interactive, such as:

* Displaying dynamic content (e.g., date, user name)
* Validating user input in forms
* Updating content without reloading the page

### Example of Client-Side JavaScript:

* Display a welcome message after a user logs in.
* Validate a credit card number or email format.
* Calculate the total cost of selected products in an online shop.

The JavaScript code can be embedded directly in HTML pages or in separate `.js` files.

## 5. Server-side JavaScript

Server-side JavaScript is executed on the web server. The server processes requests, interacts with databases, and sends dynamic content to the client.

### How Server-Side JavaScript Works:

* The server executes JavaScript code to fetch data (e.g., user details, product information) from a database.
* It then sends the processed data to the client’s browser, where it’s displayed as part of the web page.

Unlike client-side JavaScript, server-side JavaScript runs on the server and is not visible to the user.
